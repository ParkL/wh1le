Implementation of the while language and the available expression analysis for a homework. I thought I'd rather write the thing down instead of doing the analysis by hand.

TODO:

- Proper documentation
- Lexer and Parser OR proper embedding into scala
- Implementing the optimization algorithm in an abstract fashion (partial).
- Tail calls for functions like "flow" / using scala functors where possible.
- Automatic label counting
